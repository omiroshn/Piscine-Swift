# MYCV

### Description

This project was inspired by the book "50 days before my suicide" *(Don't think anything, I'm just using it to make a cool introduction)*. The girl in that book used to have a diary in which she wrote everything about her life.
I've created a secure app, in which you can write whatever you want, load beautiful photos and edit your old notes.  This app is very secure - for authorization, it uses **FaceID/TouchID** or password.
Diary supports **3 languages**: English, Russian and Ukrainian, depends on your Device language.

### Features
- **Own** pod which uses CoreData
- Localization
- FaceID/TouchID
- TableView with custom cells
- Sorting by modification date (all new articles are on top)
- Loading photos from libraty or from camera

### Requirements
- swift 4.0+ and Xcode 10.2
- installed Pods: omiroshn2019

### How to install pods
